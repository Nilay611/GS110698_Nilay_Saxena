## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
- Start the development server:
  ```sh
  npm run dev  # or yarn dev
  ```
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Running Tests
- Execute unit tests:
  ```sh
  npm test  # or yarn test
  ```
- Run end-to-end tests (if applicable):
  ```sh
  npm run test:e2e  # or yarn test:e2e
  ```

## üåü Accomplishments & Proficiency
### What Went Well:
1. **State Management with Redux Toolkit:**
   - Used `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk` effectively.
   - Ensured optimized state updates and seamless API integration.

2. **Excel Data Parsing & Processing:**
   - Implemented robust XLSX parsing logic.
   - Ensured smooth transformation of raw data into structured state.

3. **AG-Grid for Advanced Table Management:**
   - Used conditional formatting and dynamic rendering for better UX.
   - Implemented smooth data handling for large datasets.

4. **Added Authentication:**
   - Added a simple form authentication using React Redux.
   - Protected all the routes for unauthorized access using a higher order component.
  
5. **Created and used custom components:**
   - Built and utilized my own components like add new dialogs, logins, buttons, etc.
   - Used TailwindCSS for styling and AG-Grid and Recharts for visualization.

6. **Added unit tests in Jest:**
   - Followed Test Driven Development paradigm and added unit tests for most components using Jest and React Testing Library.

7. **Deployment on Vercel:**
   - Configured and successfully deployed the app on Vercel for easy access.

## ‚è≥ Improvements if Given 4 More Hours
1. **Improve Unit Test Coverage:**
   - Add more test cases to cover edge scenarios.
   - Increase assertion depth for Redux state updates.

2. **Optimize API & State Loading:**
   - Implement better loading indicators.
   - Optimize async calls to avoid unnecessary re-fetching.

3. **Enhance UI & User Experience:**
   - Improve error handling and user notifications.
   - Fine-tune table responsiveness and UX interactions.
  
4. **Improve the Authentication:**
   - Improve the authentication logic by using Json Web Tokens (JWTs).
   - Build a backend api for verifying the access tokens and authenticating the users.

## üìù Feedback on the Challenge
- The challenge provided a well-balanced mix of front-end development and data management.
- Clear instructions helped streamline the development process.
- Would love to see an additional real-world API integration for better context.
